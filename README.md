## Overview

Finds entities (people, places, organizations, titles) in hutime. Meant to be used with [cwrc-public-entity-dialogs](https://github.com/cwrc-public-entity-dialogs) where it runs in the browser.

Although it will not work in node.js as-is, it does use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) for http requests, and so could likely therefore use a browser/node.js compatible fetch implementation like: [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch).

## Installation

`npm i hutime-entity-lookup`

## Use

`import hutimeLookup from 'hutime-entity-lookup';`

### API

### findPerson(query)

### findPlace(query)

### findOrganization(query)

### findTitle(query)

where the 'query' argument is an object:

```js
{
    entity: "The name of the thing the user wants to find.",
    options: "TBD"
}
```

and all find\* methods return promises that resolve to an object like the following:

```json
{
  "id": "http://hutime.org/hutime/9447148209321300460003/",
  "name": "Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design",
  "nameType": "Corporate",
  "originalQueryString": "jones",
  "repository": "hutime",
  "uri": "http://hutime.org/9447148209321300460003/",
  "uriForDisplay": "https://hutime.org/9447148209321300460003/"
}
```

There are a further four methods that are mainly made available to facilitate testing (to make it easier to mock calls to the hutime service):

### getPersonLookupURI(query)

### getPlaceLookupURI(query)

### getOrganizationLookupURI(query)

### getTitleLookupURI(query)

where the 'query' argument is the entity name to find and the methods return the hutime URL that in turn returns results for the query.

## Development

[CWRC-Writer-Dev-Docs](https://github.com/cwrc/CWRC-Writer-Dev-Docs) describes general development practices for CWRC-Writer GitHub repositories, including this one.

<!-- ### Testing

The code in this repository is intended to run in the browser, and so we use [browser-run](https://github.com/juliangruber/browser-run) to run [browserified](http://browserify.org) [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) tests directly in the browser.

We [decorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) with [tape-promise](https://github.com/jprichardson/tape-promise) to allow testing with promises and async methods. -->

### Mocking

We use [fetch-mock](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock) to mock http calls (which we make using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) rather than XMLHttpRequest).

<!-- We use [sinon](http://sinonjs.org) [fake timers](http://sinonjs.org/releases/v4.0.1/fake-timers/) to test our timeouts, without having to wait for the timeouts. -->

<!-- ### Code Coverage

We generate code coverage by instrumenting our code with [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) before [browser-run](https://github.com/juliangruber/browser-run) runs the tests, then extract the coverage (which [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) writes to the global object, i.e., the window in the browser), format it with [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul), and finally report (Travis actually does this for us) to [codecov.io](codecov.io) -->

<!-- ### Transpilation

We use [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) and [babel-plugin-istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul) to compile our code, tests, and code coverage with [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) -->

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org).

### Release

We follow [SemVer](http://semver.org), which [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) makes easy. Semantic Release also writes our commit messages, sets the version number, publishes to NPM, and finally generates a changelog and a release (including a git tag) on GitHub.
